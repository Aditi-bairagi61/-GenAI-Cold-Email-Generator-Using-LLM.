    "## <u>Problem Definition\n",
    "</u>Many software and AI service companies, like TCS and Infosys, want to get projects from big companies like Nike and JP Morgan. To do this, they often send \"cold emails\" to potential clients to persuade them to use their services. However, writing these emails that fit the specific needs of each client can take a lot of time and effort. The main issue is that sales teams need an easy way to make personalized emails that match the job postings, which show what skills and experience"

    "#### Example Explanation of project:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a software company called Atlick that wants to work with big businesses like Nike. They notice that Nike is looking for a software engineer with skills in Machine Learning and Python. Instead of manually writing an email, Atlick uses the Cold Email Generator tool. They copy the job posting and paste it into the tool, which quickly identifies the role and required skills. The tool then creates a personalized email, saying something like, “Hi Nike Team, I see you need a software engineer skilled in Machine Learning and Python. At Atlick, we have talented engineers ready to help you. Here’s a link to our previous projects in this area.” This email is sent to Nike, increasing Atlick’s chances of getting a response and winning new work, all thanks to the tool that saves them time and ensures their message is relevant.\n",
